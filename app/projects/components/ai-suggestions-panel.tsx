                Our proposed technical architecture employs a cloud-native microservices approach designed for
                scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The architecture consists of:
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>1. Frontend Layer:</strong> A React-based single-page application (SPA) with responsive design
                principles, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices. The frontend communicates with backend
                services via RESTful APIs.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>2. API Gateway:</strong> Serves as the entry point for all client requests, handling
                authentication, request routing, and rate limiting. We utilize AWS API Gateway for this component.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>3. Microservices:</strong> Core business functionality is implemented as containerized
                microservices, each responsible for a specific domain. These services are developed using Node.js and
                deployed as Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>4. Data Layer:</strong> A hybrid data storage approach with PostgreSQL for relational data and
                MongoDB for document storage. Redis is used for caching to improve performance.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>5. Integration Layer:</strong> A combination of RESTful APIs and event-driven messaging using
                Apache Kafka ensures reliable communication between services.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>6. Monitoring & Observability:</strong> Comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana,
                with distributed tracing via Jaeger to ensure system health and performance.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Please see the attached architecture diagram for a visual representation of these components and their
                interactions.

                Our technical architecture follows a modern, cloud-agnostic approach that prioritizes security,
                scalability, and maintainability. The architecture is composed of several distinct layers:
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>1. Presentation Layer:</strong> A responsive web application built with React and TypeScript,
                following accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA). The UI components are modular and reusable, enabling
                rapid development and consistent user experience.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>2. API Management:</strong> An API gateway (Kong) that handles cross-cutting concerns such as
                authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and request routing.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>3. Service Layer:</strong> Domain-driven microservices implemented using Node.js and Express,
                each with clear boundaries and responsibilities. Services communicate through both synchronous (REST)
                and asynchronous (message queue) patterns.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>4. Data Management:</strong> A polyglot persistence approach with PostgreSQL for transactional
                data, Elasticsearch for search capabilities, and Redis for caching and session management.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>5. Infrastructure:</strong> Containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes, with
                infrastructure-as-code practices using Terraform. This enables consistent environments across
                development, testing, and production.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>6. DevOps & Monitoring:</strong> CI/CD pipelines with automated testing, deployment, and
                rollback capabilities. Comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
